<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>Nowadays there are various software tools available to process data from non-target analysis (NTA) experiments. Individual tools such as <a href="http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/">ProteoWizard</a>, <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html">XCMS</a>, <a href="http://openms.de/">OpenMS</a>, <a href="http://ipb-halle.github.io/MetFrag/">MetFrag</a> and mass spectrometry vendor tools are often combined to perform a complete data processing workflow. During this workflow, raw data files may undergo pre-treatment (e.g. conversion), chromatographic and mass spectral data are combined to extract so called <em>features</em> (or ‘peaks’) and finally annotation is performed to elucidate chemical identities. The aim of <code>patRoon</code> is to harmonize the many available tools in order to provide a consistent user interface without the need to know all the details of each individual software tool and remove the need for tedious conversion of data when multiple tools are used. The name is derived from a Dutch word that means <em>pattern</em> and may also be an acronym for <em>hyPhenated mAss specTROmetry nOn-target aNalysis</em>. The workflow of non-target analysis is typically highly dependent on several factors such as the analytical instrumentation used and requirements of the study. For this reason, <code>patRoon</code> does not enforce a certain workflow. Instead, most workflow steps are optional, are highly configurable and algorithms can easily be mixed or even combined. Furthermore, <code>patRoon</code> supplies a straightforward interface to easily inspect, select, visualize and report all data that is generated during the workflow.</p>
<p>The documentation of <code>patRoon</code> consists of three parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A tutorial (accessible at <a href="https://rickhelmus.github.io/patRoon/articles/tutorial.html">here</a>)</li>
<li>This handbook</li>
<li>The reference manual (accessible in <code>R</code> with <code><a href="../reference/patRoon-package.html">?`patRoon-package`</a></code> or online <a href="https://rickhelmus.github.io/patRoon/reference/index.html">here</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>New users are highly recommended to start with the tutorial: this document provides an interactive introduction in performing a basic NTA processing workflow with <code>patRoon</code>. The handbook provides a more thorough overview of all concepts, functionalities and provides instructions and many examples on working with <code>patRoon</code>. Finally, the reference manual provides all the gritty details for all functionalities, and is meant if you want to know more details or need a quick reminder how a function should be used.</p>
</div>
<div id="installation" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#installation" class="anchor"></a>Installation</h1>
<p><code>patRoon</code> depends on various other software tools to perform the non-target analysis workflow steps and to implement various other functionality. Most of these dependencies are automatically installed when you install the <code>patRoon</code> R package, however, some may need to be manually installed and/or configured.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong> It is highly recommended to perform installation steps in a ‘clean’ <code>R</code> session to avoid errors when installing or upgrading packages. As such it is recommended to close all open (R Studio) sessions and open a plain R console to perform the installation.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="automatic-installation-windows-only" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#automatic-installation-windows-only" class="anchor"></a>Automatic installation (Windows only)</h2>
<p>An installation script is provided that automatically installs and configures all dependencies and finally installs <code>patRoon</code> itself. At this moment, this script only works with Microsoft Windows. You don’t have to install anything else to use it, simply open <code>R</code> and execute these commands:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/source.html">source</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rickhelmus/patRoon/master/install_patRoon.R"</span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="fu">installPatRoon</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A simple text based wizard will start and asks you what to install and how to do it. You can re-run this installer at any time, for instance, if something went wrong or you want to install additional dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div id="docker-image" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#docker-image" class="anchor"></a>Docker image</h2>
<p>Docker images are provided to easily install a reproducible environment with <code>R</code>, <code>patRoon</code> and nearly all of its dependencies. This section assumes you have a basic understanding of <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and have it installed. If not, please refer to the many guides available on the Internet. The Docker images of <code>patRoon</code> were originally only used for automated testing, however, since these contain a complete working environment of <code>patRoon</code> they are also suitable for using the software. They come with all external dependencies (except ProteoWizard), <code>R</code> dependencies and <code>MetFrag</code> libraries. Furthermore, the Docker image also contains <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> server, which makes using <code>patRoon</code> even easier.</p>
<p>Below are some example shell commands on how to run the image.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># run an interactive R console session</span></span>

<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># same as above, but mount a local directory (~/myvolume) as local volume so it can be used for persistent storage</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># please ensure that ~/myvolume exists!</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">--rm</span> <span class="at">-p</span> 8787:8787 <span class="at">-u</span> 0 <span class="at">-e</span> PASSWORD=yourpasswordhere <span class="at">-v</span> ~/myvolume:/home/rstudio/myvolume patroonorg/patroonrs /init</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the first two commands run as the default user <code>rstudio</code>, while the last two as <code>root</code>. The last commands launch <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> server. You can access it by browsing to <code>localhost:8787</code> and logging in with user <code>rstudio</code> and the password defined by the <code>PASSWORD</code> variable from the command (<code>yourpasswordhere</code> in the above example). The last command also links a local volume in order to obtain persistence of files in the container’s home directory. The Docker image is based on the excellent work from the <a href="https://www.rocker-project.org/">rocker project</a>. For more information on RStudio related options see their documentation for the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio">RStudio image</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="manual-installation" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#manual-installation" class="anchor"></a>Manual installation</h2>
<p>The manual installation is for users who don’t use Windows or Docker, prefer to do a manual installation or simply want to know what happens behind the scenes. The manual installation consists of three phases:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Installing some prerequisite <code>R</code> packages</li>
<li>Install and configure (non-<code>R</code>) dependencies</li>
<li>Install <code>patRoon</code>
</li>
</ol>
<div id="r-prerequisites" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#r-prerequisites" class="anchor"></a>R prerequisites</h3>
<p>When installing <code>patRoon</code> Windows users have the option to install from a customized (<a href="https://github.com/andrie/miniCRAN">miniCRAN</a>) repository (<code>patRoonDeps</code>). This repository provides a central repository for <code>patRoon</code> and all its R packages. An advantage is that installation will be faster and you will not need to install <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/">Rtools</a>. Note that you will need to have the latest <code>R</code> version installed in order to use this repository.</p>
<p>When you decide to use the <code>patRoonDeps</code> repository you can simply <em>skip</em> this step. <strong>Otherwise</strong> (i.e. you will use regular repositories instead), the following will install the <code>R</code> dependencies.</p>

<p>Most of these packages are optional and only needed if their algorithms are used during the workflow. If you are unsure which are needed, simply skip them for now and install them at a later stage.</p>
<p>After installation of these dependencies you may need to configure their filepaths (OpenMS and ProteoWizard are usually found automatically). To configure the file locations you should set some global package options with the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/options.html">options()</a></code> R function, for instance:</p>

<p>These commands have to be executed everytime you start a new R session (e.g. as part of your script). However, it is probably easier to add them to your <code>~/.Rprofile</code> file so that they are executed automatically when you start R.

<p>In a non-target workflow both chromatographic and mass spectral data is automatically processed in order to provide a comprehensive chemical characterization of your samples. While the exact workflow is typically dependent on the type of study, it generally involves of the following steps:</p>

In the scheme above you can recognize optional steps by a <em>dashed line</em>. The inclusion of each step is only necessary if a further steps depends on its data. For instance, annotation and componentization do not depend on each other and can therefore be executed in any order or simply be omitted. A brief description of all steps is given below.</p>
<p>During <strong>data pre-treatment</strong> raw MS data is prepared for further analysis. A common need for this step is to convert the data to an open format so that other tools are able to process it. Other pre-treatment steps may involve re-calibration of <em>m/z</em> data or performing advanced filtering operations.</p>
<p>The next step is to extract <strong>features</strong> from the data. While different terminologies are used, a feature in <code>patRoon</code> refers to a single chromatographic peak in an extracted ion chromatogram for a single <em>m/z</em> value (within a defined tolerance). Hence, a feature contains both chromatographic data (e.g. retention time and peak height) and mass spectral data (e.g. the accurate <em>m/z</em>). Note that with mass spectrometry multiple <em>m/z</em> values may be detected for a single compound as a result of adduct formation, natural isotopes and/or in-source fragments. Some algorithms may try to combine these different masses in a single feature. However, in <code>patRoon</code> we generally assume this is not the case (and may optionally be done afterwards during the componentization step described below). Features are sometimes simply referred to as ‘peaks’.</p>
<p>Features are found per analysis. Hence, in order to compare a feature across analyses, the next step is to group them. This step is essential as it finds equal features even if their retention time or <em>m/z</em> values slightly differ due to analytical variability. The resulting <strong>feature groups</strong> are crucial input for subsequent workflow steps. Prior to grouping, <em>retention time alignment</em> between analyses may be performed to improve grouping of features, especially when processing multiple analysis batches at once. Outside <code>patRoon</code> feature groups may also be defined as <em>profiles</em>, <em>aligned</em> or <em>grouped features</em> or <em>buckets</em>.</p>
<p>Depending on the study type, <strong>suspect screening</strong> is then performed to limit the features that should be considered for further processing. As its name suggests, with suspect screening only those features which are suspected to be present are considered for further processing. These suspects are retrieved from a suspect list which contains the <em>m/z</em> and (optionally) retention times for each suspect. Typical suspect lists may be composed from databases with known pollutants or from predicted transformation products. Note that for a ‘full’ non-target analysis no suspect screening is performed, hence, this step is simply omitted and all features are to be considered.</p>
<p>The feature group data may then be subjected to <strong>componentization</strong>. A <strong>component</strong> is defined as a collection of multiple feature groups that are somehow related to each other. Typical examples are features that belong to the same chemical compound (i.e. with different <em>m/z</em> values but equal retention time), such as adducts, isotopes and in-source fragments. Other examples are homologous series and features that display a similar intensity trend across samples. If adducts or isotopes were annotated during componentization then this data may be used to prioritize the feature groups.</p>
<p>The last step in the workflow commonly involves <strong>annotation</strong>. During this step MS and MS/MS data are collected in so called <strong>MS peak lists</strong>, which are then used as input for formula and compound annotation. Formula annotation involves automatic calculation of possible formulae for each feature based on its <em>m/z</em>, isotopic pattern and MS/MS fragments, whereas compound annotation (or identification) involves the assignment of actual chemical structures to each feature. Note that during formula and compound annotation typically multiple candidates are assigned to a single feature. To assist interpretation of this data each candidate is therefore ranked on characteristics such as isotopic fit, number of explained MS/MS fragments and metadata from an online database such as number of scientific references or presence in common suspect lists.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Data-pretreatment</strong> involves preparing raw MS data for further processing (e.g. conversion to an open format)</li>
<li>
<strong>Features</strong> describe chromatographic and <em>m/z</em> information (or ‘peaks’) in all analyses.</li>
<li>A <strong>feature group</strong> consists of equal features across analyses.</li>
<li>With <strong>suspect screening</strong> only features that are considered to be on a suspect list are considered further in the workflow.</li>
<li>
<strong>Componentization</strong> involves consolidating different feature groups that have a relationship to each other in to a single component.</li>
<li>
<strong>MS peak lists</strong> Summarizes all MS and MS/MS data that will be used for subsequent annotation.</li>
<li>During <strong>formula</strong> and <strong>compound annotation</strong> candidate formulae/structures will be assigned and ranked for each feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next chapters will discuss how to generate this data and process it.

<p>Each step in the non-target workflow is performed by a function that performs the heavy lifting of a workflow step behind the scenes and finally return the results. An important goal of <code>patRoon</code> is to support multiple algorithms for each workflow step, hence, when such a function is called you have to specify which algorithm you want to use. The available algorithms and their characteristics will be discussed in the next sections. An overview of all functions involved in generating workflow data is shown in the table below.</p>

<p>All of these functions store their output in objects derived from so called S4 classes. Knowing the details about the S4 class system of <code>R</code> is generally not important when using <code>patRoon</code> (and well written resources are available if you want to know more). In brief, usage of this class system allows a general data format that is used irrespective of the algorithm that was used to generate the data. For instance, when features have been found by <a href="http://openms.de/">OpenMS</a> or <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html">XCMS</a> they both return the same data format.</p>
<p>Another advantage of the S4 class system is the usage of so called <em>generic functions</em>. To put simply: a generic function performs a certain task for different types of data objects. A good example is the <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">plotSpectrum()</a></code> function which plots an (annotated) spectrum from data of MS peak lists or from formula or compound annotation:</p>

<p>The <code><a href="../reference/convertMSFiles.html">convertMSFiles()</a></code> function supports conversion between many different file formats typically used in non-target analysis. Furthermore, other pre-treatment steps are available (e.g. centroiding, filtering) when the <a href="http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/">ProteoWizard</a> algorithm is used. For an overview of these functionalities see the <a href="http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/tools/msconvert.html">MsConvert documentation</a>. Some examples:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong> Most algorithms further down the workflow require the <em>mzML</em> or <em>mzXML</em> file format and additionally require that mass peaks have been centroided. When using the ProteoWizard algorithm (the default), centroiding by vendor algorithms is generally recommended (i.e. by setting <code>centroid="vendor"</code> as shown in the above example).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Bruker MS data is used it can be automatically re-calibrated to improve its mass accuracy. Often this is preceeded by calling the <code><a href="../reference/bruker-utils.html">setDAMethod()</a></code> function to set a DataAnalysis method to all files in order to configure automatic re-calibration. The <code><a href="../reference/bruker-utils.html">recalibrarateDAFiles()</a></code> function performs the actual re-calibration. The <code><a href="../reference/bruker-utils.html">getDACalibrationError()</a></code> function can be used at anytime to request the current calibration error of each analysis. An example of these functions is shown below.</p>

<a href="#anaInfo" class="anchor"></a>Analysis information</h3>
<p>The final bits of preparation is constructing the information for the analyses that need to be processed. In <code>patRoon</code> this is referred to as the <em>analysis information</em> and often stored in a variable <code>anaInfo</code> (of course you are free to choose a different name!). The analysis information should be a <code>data.frame</code> with the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>path</strong>: the directory path of the file containing the analysis data</li>
<li>
<strong>analysis</strong>: the name of the analysis. This should be the file name <em>without</em> file extension.</li>
<li>
<strong>group</strong>: to which <em>replicate group</em> the analysis belongs. All analysis which are replicates of each other get the same name.</li>
<li>
<strong>blank</strong>: which replicate group should be used for blank subtraction.</li>
<li>
<strong>conc</strong> (optional, advanced) A numeric value describing the concentration or any other value for which the intensity in this sample may correlate, for instance, dilution factor, sampling time etc. This column is only required when you want to obtain quantitative information (e.g. concentrations) using the <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">as.data.table()</a></code> method function (see <code><a href="../reference/featureGroups-class.html">?featureGroups</a></code> for more information).</li>

<p>(Note that for the example data the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/patRoonData/man/patRoonData.html">patRoonData::exampleAnalysisInfo()</a></code> function can also be used.)</p>
<p>Alternatively, the <code><a href="../reference/newProject.html">newProject()</a></code> function discussed in the next section can be used to interactively construct this information.</p>

<a href="#newProject" class="anchor"></a>Automatic project generation with newProject()</h3>
<p>The previous sections already highlighted some steps that have to be performed prior to starting a new non-target analysis workflow: data pre-treatment and gathering information on the analysis. Most of the times you will put this and other <code>R</code> code a script file so you can recall what you have done before (i.e. reproducible research).</p>
<p>The <code><a href="../reference/newProject.html">newProject()</a></code> function can be used to setup a new project. When you run this function it will launch a small tool (see screenshot below) where you can select your analyses and configure the various workflow steps which you want to execute (e.g. data pre-treatment, finding features, annotation etc). After setting everything up the function will generate a template script which can easily be edited afterwards. In addition, you have the option to create a new RStudio project, which is advantegeous as it neatly seperates your data processing work from the rest.</p>

<p>Most often the performance of these algorithms heavily depend on the data and parameter settings that are used. Since obtaining a good feature dataset is crucial for the rest of the workflow, it is highly recommended to experiment with different settings (this process can also be automated, see <a href="#fOpt">the feature optimization section</a> for more details). Some common parameters to look at are listed in the table below. However, there are many more parameters that can be set, please see the reference documentation for these (e.g. <code><a href="../reference/feature-finding.html">?findFeatures</a></code>).</p>

<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong>: Grouping features with the <code>sirius</code> algorithm will perform both finding and grouping features with <a href="https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/">SIRIUS</a>. This algorithm cannot work with features from another algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like finding features, each algorithm has their own set of parameters. Often the defaults are a good start but it is recommended to have look at them. See <code><a href="../reference/feature-grouping.html">?groupFeatures</a></code> for more details.</p>
<p>When using the <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html">XCMS</a> algorithms both the ‘classical’ interface and latest <code>XCMS3</code> interfaces are supported. Currently, both interfaces are mostly the same regarding functionalities and implementation. However, since future developments of XCMS are primarily focused the latter this interface is recommended.</p>

<p>After features have been grouped a so called suspect screening step may be performed to find features that may correspond to suspects within a given suspect list. The <code><a href="../reference/suspect-screening.html">screenSuspects()</a></code> function is used for this purpose, for instance:</p>

<div id="suspect-list-format" class="section level4">
<h4 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#suspect-list-format" class="anchor"></a>Suspect list format</h4>
<p>The example above has a very simple suspect list with just three compounds. The format of the suspect list is quite flexible, and can contain the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>name</code>: The name of the suspect. Mandatory and should be unique and file-name compatible (if not, the name will be automatically re-named to make it compatible).</li>
<li>
<code>rt</code>: The retention time in seconds. Optional. If specified any feature groups with a different retention time will not be considered to match suspects.</li>
<li>
<code>mz</code>, <code>SMILES</code>, <code>InChI</code>, <code>formula</code>, <code>neutralMass</code>: <em>at least</em> one of these columns must hold data for each suspect row. The <code>mz</code> column specifies the ionized mass of the suspect. If this is not available then data from any of the other columns is used to determine the suspect mass.</li>
<li>
<code>adduct</code>: The adduct of the suspect. Optional. Set this if you are sure that a suspect should be matched by a particular adduct ion and no data in the <code>mz</code> column is available.</li>
<li>
<code>fragments_mz</code> and <code>fragments_formula</code>: optional columns that may assist <a href="#suspAnn">suspect annotation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases a suspect list is best made as a <code>csv</code> file which can then be imported with e.g. the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/read.table.html">read.csv()</a></code> function. This is exactly what happen when you specify a suspect list when using the <code><a href="../reference/newProject.html">newProject()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>Quite often, the ionized masses are not readily available and these have to be calculated. In this case, data in any of the <code>SMILES</code>/<code>InChI</code>/<code>formula</code>/<code>neutralMass</code> columns should be provided. Whenever possible, it is <em>strongly</em> recommended to fill in <code>SMILES</code> column (or <code>InChI</code>), as this will assist <a href="#suspAnn">annotation</a>. Applying this to the above example:</p>

<p>Since suspect matching now occurs by the neutral mass it is required that the adduct information for the feature groups are set.

<p>Finally, when the adduct is known for a suspect it can be specified in the suspect list:</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a suspect has data in the <code>mz</code> column it will be directly matched with the <em>m/z</em> value of a feature group.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the suspect has data in the <code>adduct</code> column, the <code>m/z</code> value for the suspect is calculated from its neutral mass and the adduct and then matched with the <code>m/z</code> of a feature group.</li>
<li>Otherwise, suspects and feature groups are matched by their the neutral mass.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>fragments_mz</code> and <code>fragments_formula</code> columns in the suspect list can be used to specify known fragments for a suspect, which can help <a href="#suspAnn">suspect annotation</a>. The former specifies the ionized <em>m/z</em> of known MS/MS peaks, whereas the second specifies known formulas. Multiple values can be given by separating them with a semicolon:</p>

<p>Note that any feature groups that were not matched to a suspect are <em>not</em> removed by default. If you want to remove these, you can use the <code>onlyHits</code> parameter:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>The advantage of removing non-hits is that it may significantly reduce the complexity of your dataset. On the other hand, retaining all features allows you to mix a full non-target analysis with a suspect screening workflow. The <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">filter()</a></code> function (discussed <a href="#filtering">here</a>) can also be used to remove feature groups without a hit at a later stage.</p>

<p>In this example the suspect lists defined in <code>suspects</code> and <code>suspects2</code> are both used for screening.

<li>Homologous series: features with increasing <em>m/z</em> and retention time.</li>
<li>Intensity profiles: features that follow a similar intensity profile in the analyses.</li>

<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#componentsChrom" class="anchor"></a>Features with similar chromatographic behaviour</h3>
<p>Isotopes, adducts and in-source fragments typically result in detection of multiple mass peaks by the mass spectrometer for a single chemical compound. While some feature finding algorithms already try to collapse (some of) these in to a single feature, this process is often incomplete (if performed at all) and it is not uncommon that multiple features will describe the same compound. To overcome this complexity several algorithms can be used to group features that undergo highly similar chromatographic behavior but have different <em>m/z</em> values. Basic chemical rules are then applied to the resulting components to annotate adducts, in-source fragments and isotopologues, which may be highly useful for general identification purposes.</p>
<p>Note that some algorithms were primarily designed for datasets where features are generally present in the majority of the analyses (as is relatively common in metabolomics). For environmental analyses, however, this is often not the case. For instance, consider the following situation with three feature groups that chromatographically overlap and therefore could be considered a component:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead><tr class="header">
<th>Feature group</th>
<th><em>m/z</em></th>
<th>analysis 1</th>
<th>analysis 2</th>
<th>analysis 3</th>

</table>
<p>Based on the mass differences from this example a cluster of <code>[M+H]+</code>, <code>[M+Na]+</code> and <code>[M+K]+</code> could be assumed. However, no features of the first two feature groups were detected in the third sample analysis, whereas the third feature group wasn’t detected in the first two sample analysis. Based on this it seems unlikely that feature group <em>#3</em> should be part of the component.</p>
<p>For the algorithms that operate on a ‘feature group level’ (<a href="http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/msbi/CAMERA/">CAMERA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sneumann/RAMClustR">RAMClustR</a>), the <code>relMinReplicates</code> argument can be used to remove feature groups from a component that are not abundant. For instance, when this value is <em>0.5</em> (the default), and all the features of a component were detected in four different replicate groups in total, then only those feature groups are kept for which its features were detected in at least two different replicate groups (<em>i.e.</em> half of four).</p>
<p>Another approach to reduce unlikely adduct annotations is to use algorithms that operate on a ‘feature level’ (<a href="https://github.com/osenan/cliqueMS">cliqueMS</a> and <a href="http://openms.de/">OpenMS</a>). These algorithms generate components for each sample analysis individually. The ‘feature components’ are then merged by a consensus approach where unlikely annotations are removed (the algorithm is described further in the reference manual, <code><a href="../reference/component-generation.html">?generateComponents</a></code>).</p>
<p>Each algorithm supports many different parameters that may significantly influence the (quality of the) output. For instance, care has to be taken to avoid ‘over-clustering’ of feature groups which do not belong in the same component. This is often easily visible since the chromatographic peaks poorly overlap or are shaped differently. The <code>checkComponents</code> function (discussed <a href="#intReview">here</a>) can be used to quickly verify componentization results. For a complete listing all arguments see the reference manual (e.g. <code><a href="../reference/component-generation.html">?generateComponents</a></code>).</p>
<p>Once the components with adduct and isotopes annotations are generated this data can be <a href="#incorpAdductIso">used to prioritize and improve the workflow</a>.</p>

<a href="#incorpAdductIso" class="anchor"></a>Incorporating adduct and isotopic data</h2>
<p>With mass spectrometry it is common that multiple <em>m/z</em> values are detected for a single compound. These may be different adducts (e.g. <code>[M+H]+</code>, <code>[M+Na]+</code>, <code>[M-H]-</code>), the different isotopes of the molecule or a combination thereof. When multiple <em>m/z</em> values are measured for the same compound, the feature finding algorithm may yield a distinct feature for each, which adds complexity to the data. In <a href="#componentsChrom">the previous section</a> it was discussed how componentization can help to find feature groups that belong to the same adduct and/or isotope clusters. This section explains how this data can be used to simplify the feature dataset. Furthermore, this section also covers adduct annotations for feature groups which may improve and simplify the general workflow.</p>

<p>The <code>selectIons</code> function forms the bridge between feature group and componentization data. This function uses the adduct and isotope annotations to select <em>preferential</em> feature groups. For adduct clusters this means that only the feature group that has a preferential adduct (e.g. <code>[M+H]+</code>) is kept while others (e.g. <code>[M+Na]+</code>) are removed. If none of the adduct annotations are considered preferential, the most intense feature group is kept instead. For isotopic clusters typically only the feature group with the monoisotopic mass (i.e. <em>M0</em>) is kept.</p>
<p>The behavior of <code>selectIons</code> is configurable with the following parameters:</p>

<p>In case componentization did not lead to an adduct annotation for a feature group it will never be removed and simply be annotated with the preferential adduct. Similarly, when no isotope annotations are available and <code>onlyMonoIso=TRUE</code>, the feature group will not be removed.</p>

<p>When feature groups have adduct annotations available this may simplify and improve the workflow.

<p>The recommended default algorithm is <code>mzr</code>: this algorithm is generally faster and is not limited to a vendor data format as it will read the open <code>mzML</code> and <code>mzXML</code> file formats. On the other hand, when DataAnalysis is used with Bruker data the spectra can be automatically background subtracted and there is no need for file conversion. Note that the <code>brukerfmf</code> algorithm only works when <code><a href="../reference/feature-finding.html">findFeatures()</a></code> was called with the <code>bruker</code> algorithm.</p>
<p>When <code>generateMSPeakists()</code> is called it will</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Find all MS and MS/MS spectra that ‘belong’ to a feature. For MS spectra this means that all spectra close to the retention time of a feature will be collected. In addition, for MS/MS normally only spectra will be considered that have a precursor mass close to that of the feature (however, this can be disabled for data that was recorded with data independent acquisition (DIA, MS^E, bbCID, …)).</li>
<li>Average all MS and MS/MS spectra to produce peak lists for each feature.</li>
<li>Average all peak lists for features within the same group.</li>
</ol>
<p>Data from either (2) or (3) is used for subsequent annotation steps. Formula calculation can use either (as a trade-off between possibly more accurate results by outlier removal <em>vs</em> speed), whereas compound annotation will always use data from (3) since annotating single features (as opposed to their groups) would take a very long time.</p>

<p>Calculation with <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/genform/">GenForm</a> is often a good default. It is fast and basic rules can be applied to filter out obvious non-existing formulae. A possible drawback of GenForm, however, is that may become slow when many candidates are calculated, for instance, due to a relative high feature <em>m/z</em> (e.g. &gt;600) or loose elemental restricitions. More thorough calculation is performed with <a href="https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/">SIRIUS</a>: this algorithm often yields fewer and often more plausible results. However, <a href="https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/">SIRIUS</a> requires MS/MS data (hence features without will not have results) and formula prediction may not work well for compounds that structurally deviate from the training sets used by <a href="https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/">SIRIUS</a>. Calculation with DataAnalysis is only possible when features are obtained with DataAnalysis as well. An advantage is that analysis files do not have to be converted, however, compared to other algorithms calculation is often relative slow.</p>
<p>There are two methods for formula assignment:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Formulae are first calculated for each individual feature within a feature group. These results are then pooled, outliers are removed and remaining formulae are assigned to the feature group (i.e. <code>calculateFeatures = TRUE</code>).</li>
<li>Formulae are directly calculated for each feature group by using group averaged peak lists (see previous section) (i.e. <code>calculateFeatures = FALSE</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>The first method is more thorough and the possibility to remove outliers may sometimes result in better formula assignment. However, the second method is much faster and generally recommended for large number of analyses.</p>
<p>By default, formulae are either calculated by <em>only</em> MS/MS data (SIRIUS) or with both MS <em>and</em> MS/MS data (GenForm/Bruker). The latter also allows formula calculation when no MS/MS data is present. Furthermore, with Bruker algorithms, data from both MS and MS/MS formula data can be combined to allow inclusion of candidates that would otherwise be excluded by e.g. poor MS/MS data. However, a disadvantage is that formulae needs to be calculated twice. The <code>MSMode</code> argument (listed below) can be used to customize this behaviour.</p>

<p>An important step in a typical non-target workflow is structural identification for features of interest. Afterall, this information may finally reveal <em>what</em> a feature is. The first step is to find all possible structures in a database that may be assigned to the feature (based on e.g. monoisotopic mass or formula). These candidates are then scored to rank likely candidates, for instance, on correspondence with in-silico or library MS/MS spectra and environmental relevance.</p>
<p>Structure assignment in <code>patRoon</code> is performed automatically for all feature groups with the <code><a href="../reference/compound-generation.html">generateCompounds()</a></code> function. Currently, this function supports two algorithms:</p>

<p>Compound annotation is often a relative time and resource intensive procedure. For this reason, features are not annotated individually, but instead a feature group as a whole is annotated, which generally saves significant amounts of computational requirements. Nevertheless, it is not uncommon that this is the most time consuming step in the workflow. For this reason, prioritization of features is highly important, even more so to avoid ‘abusing’ servers when an online database is used for compound retrieval.</p>
<p>Selecting the right database is important for proper candidate assignment. Afterall, if the ‘right’ chemical compound is not present in the used database, it is impossible to assign the correct structure. Luckily, however, several large databases such as <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a> and <a href="http://www.chemspider.com/">ChemSpider</a> are openly available which contain tens of millions of compounds. On the other hand, these databases may also lead to many unlikely candidates and therefore more specialized (or custom databases) may be preferred. Which database will be used is dictated by the <code>database</code> argument to <code><a href="../reference/compound-generation.html">generateCompounds()</a></code>, currently the following options exist:</p>

<a href="#configuring-metfrag-databases-and-scoring" class="anchor"></a>Configuring MetFrag databases and scoring</h4>
<p>Some extra configuration may be necessary when using certain databases with MetFrag. In order to use the ChemSpider database a <a href="http://www.chemspider.com/AboutServices.aspx">security token</a> should be requested and set with the <code>chemSpiderToken</code> argument to <code><a href="../reference/compound-generation.html">generateCompounds()</a></code>. The CompTox and PubChemLite databases need to be manually downloaded from <a href="ftp://newftp.epa.gov/COMPTOX/Sustainable_Chemistry_Data/Chemistry_Dashboard/MetFrag_metadata_files">CompTox</a> (or variations with <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3364464#.XnjM-XLvKUk">smoking</a> or <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3472781#.XnjMAHLvKUk">wastewater</a> metadata) and <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4432124/">PubChemLite</a>. The file location of this and other local databases (<code>csv</code>, <code>psv</code>, <code>sdf</code>) needs to be manually configured, see the examples below and/or <code><a href="../reference/compound-generation.html">?generateCompounds</a></code> for more information on how to do this.</p>

<p>With MetFrag compound databases are not only used to retrieve candidate structures but are also used to obtain metadata for further ranking. Each database has its own scorings, a table with currently supported scorings can be obtained with the <code><a href="../reference/compound-generation.html">compoundScorings()</a></code> function (some columns omitted):</p>

<p>The first two columns contain the generic and original MetFrag naming schemes for each scoring type. While both naming schemes can be used, the generic is often shorter and harmonized with other algorithms (e.g. SIRIUS). The <em>database</em> column specifies for which databases a particular scoring is available (empty if not database specific). Most scorings are selected by default (as specified by the <em>default</em> column), however, this behaviour can be customized by using the <code>scoreTypes</code> argument:</p>

<p>By default ranking is performed with equal weight (i.e. <em>1</em>) for all scorings. This can be changed by the <code>scoreWeights</code> argument, which should be a <code>vector</code> containing the weights for all scorings following the order of <code>scoreTypes</code>, for instance:</p>

<p>Sometimes thousands or more structural candidates are found when annotating a feature group. In this situation processing all these candidates will too involving (especially when external databases are used). To avoid this a default cut-off is set: when the number of candidates exceed a certain amount the search will be aborted and no results will be reported for that feature group. The maximum number of candidates can be set with the <code>maxCandidatesToStop</code> argument. The default value is relative conservative, especially for local databases it may be useful to increase this number.</p>

<div id="timeout-and-error-handling" class="section level4">
<h4 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#timeout-and-error-handling" class="anchor"></a>Timeout and error handling</h4>
<p>The use of online databases has the drawback that an error may occur, for instance, as a result of a connection error. Furthermore, MetFrag typically returns an error when too many candidates are found (as set by the <code>maxCandidatesToStop</code> argument). By default processing is restarted if an error has occurred (configured by the <code>errorRetries</code> argument). Similarly, the <code>timeoutRetries</code> and <code>timeout</code> arguments can be used to avoid being ‘stuck’ on obtaining results, for instance, due to an unstable internet connection.</p>
<p>If no compounds could be assigned due to an error a warning will be issued. In this case it is best to see what went wrong by manually checking the log files, which by default are stored in the <em>log/metfrag</em> folder.</p>

<p>Ranking of candidate structures may further be improved by incorporating formula information by using the <code><a href="../reference/compounds-class.html">addFormulaScoring()</a></code> function:</p>

<p>Here, corresponding formula and explained fragments will be used to calculate a <em>formulaScore</em> for each candidate. Note that SIRIUS candidates are already based on calculated formulae, hence, running this function on SIRIUS results is less sensable unless scoring from another formula calculation algorithm is desired.</p>

<p>The calculation of identification levels is performed by a set of pre-defined rules. The <code><a href="../reference/suspect-screening.html">genIDLevelRulesFile()</a></code> can be used to inspect the default rules or to create your own rules file, which can subsequently passed to <code><a href="../reference/featureGroupsScreening-class.html">annotateSuspects()</a></code> with the <code>IDFile</code> argument. See <code><a href="../reference/featureGroupsScreening-class.html">?annotateSuspects</a></code> for more details on the file format and options. The default identification levels can be summarized as follows:</p>

</table>
<p>In general, the more data provided by the suspect list and to <code><a href="../reference/featureGroupsScreening-class.html">annotateSuspects()</a></code>, the better identification level estimation works. For instance, when considering the default rules, either the <code>fragments_mz</code> or <code>fragments_formula</code> column is necessary to be able assign a <code>level 3b</code>. Similarly, the suspect list needs retention times (as well as fragment data) to be able to assign <code>level 1</code>. As you can imagine, providing the annotation workflow objects (i.e. <code>MSPeakLists</code>, <code>formulas</code>, <code>compounds</code>) to <code><a href="../reference/featureGroupsScreening-class.html">annotateSuspects()</a></code> is necessary for calculation of most levels.</p>
<p>The <code><a href="../reference/featureGroupsScreening-class.html">annotateSuspects()</a></code> function will log decisions for identification level assignments to the <code>log/</code> sub-directory in the current working directory. This is useful to inspect level assignments and especially useful when you customized any rules.</p>

<p>A more sophisticated way to obtain data from a workflow object is to use <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">as.data.table()</a></code> or <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">as.data.frame()</a></code>. These functions will convert <em>all</em> information within the object to a table (<code>data.table</code> or <code>data.frame</code>) and allow various options to add extra information. An advantage is that this common data format can be used with many other functions within <code>R</code>. The output is in a <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html">tidy format</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong> If you are not familiar with <code>data.table</code> and want to know more see <a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki">data.table</a>. Briefly, this is a more efficient and largely compatible alternative to the regular <code>data.frame</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong> The <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">as.data.frame()</a></code> methods defined in <code>patRoon</code> simply convert the results from <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">as.data.table()</a></code>, hence, both functions are equal in their usage and are defined for the same object classes.</p>

<p>During a non-target workflow it is not uncommon that some kind of data-cleanup is necessary. Datasets are often highly complex, which makes separating data of interest from the rest highly important. Furthermore, general cleanup typically improves the quality of the dataset, for instance by removing low scoring annotation results or features that are unlikely to be ‘correct’ (e.g. noise or present in blanks). For this reason <code>patRoon</code> supports <em>many</em> different filters that easily clean data produced during the workflow in a highly customizable way.</p>
<p>All major workflow objects (e.g. <code>featureGroups</code>, <code>compounds</code>, <code>components</code> etc.) support filtering operations by the <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">filter()</a></code> generic. This function takes the object to be filtered as first argument and any remaining arguments describe the desired filter options. The <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">filter()</a></code> generic function then returns the modified object back. Some examples are shown below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong> Some other <code>R</code> packages (notably <code>dplyr</code>) also provide a <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">filter()</a></code> generic function. To use the <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">filter()</a></code> function from different packages you may need to explicitly specify which one to use in your script. This can be done by prefixing it with the package name, e.g. <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">patRoon::filter(...)</a></code>, <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html">dplyr::filter(...)</a></code> etc.</p>

<p>Application of filters to feature data is important for (environmental) non-target analysis. Especially blank and replicate filters (i.e. <code>blankThreshold</code> and <code>absMinReplicateAbundance</code>/<code>relMinReplicateAbundance</code>) are important filters and are highly recommended to always apply for cleaning up your dataset.</p>
<p>All filters are available for feature group data, whereas only a subset is available for feature objects. The main reason is that other filters need grouping of features between analyses. Regardless, in <code>patRoon</code> filtering feature data is less important, and typically only needed when the number of features are extremely large and direct grouping is undesired.</p>
<p>From the table above you can notice that many filters concern both <em>absolute</em> and <em>relative</em> data (i.e. as prefixed with <code>abs</code> and <code>rel</code>). When a relative filter is used the value is scaled between <em>0</em> and <em>1</em>. For instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb75"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="co"># remove features not present in at least half of the analyses within a replicate group</span>
<span class="va">fGroups</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/generics.html">filter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">fGroups</span>, relMinReplicateAbundance <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">0.5</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>An advantage of relative filters is that you will not have to worry about the data size involved. For instance, in the above example the filter always takes half of the number of analyses within a replicate group, even when replicate groups have different number of analyses.</p>
<p>Note that multiple filters can be specified at once. Especially for feature group data the order of filtering may impact the final results, this is explained further in the reference manual (i.e. <code><a href="../reference/feature-filtering.html">?`feature-filtering`</a></code>).</p>

<p>The <code>selectHitsBy</code> and <code>selectBestFGroups</code> filters are useful to remove duplicate hits (one suspect assigned to multiple feature groups or multiple feature groups assigned to the same suspect, respectively). The former selects based on either best identification level (<code>selectHitsBy="level"</code>) or highest mean intensity (<code>selectHitsBy="intensity"</code>). The <code>selectBestFGroups</code> can only be <code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> and always selects by best identification level.</p>

<p>Several intensity related filters are available to clean-up MS peak list data. For instance, the <code>topMSPeaks</code>/<code>topMSMSPeaks</code> filters provide a simple way to remove noisy data by only retaining a defined number of most intense mass peaks. Note that none of these filters will remove the precursor mass peak of the feature itself.</p>
<p>The filters applicable to formula and compound annotation generally concern minimal scoring or chemical properties. The former is useful to remove unlikely candidates, whereas the second is useful to focus on certain study specific chemical properties (e.g. known neutral losses).</p>

<p>All filters support <em>negation</em>: if enabled all specified filters will be executed in an opposite manner.

<a href="#subset" class="anchor"></a>Subsetting</h2>
<p>The previous section discussed the <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">filter()</a></code> generic function to perform various data cleaning operations. A more generic way to select data is by <em>subsetting</em>: here you can manually specify which parts of an object should be retained. Subsetting is supported for all workflow objects and is performed by the R subset operator (<code>"["</code>). This operator either subsets by one or two arguments, which are referred to as the <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> arguments.</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col width="16%">

<p>For objects that support two-dimensional subsetting (e.g. <code>featureGroups</code>, <code>MSPeakLists</code>), either the <code>i</code> or <code>j</code> argument is optional. Furthermore, unlike subsetting a <code>data.frame</code>, the position of <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> does not change when only one argument is specified:</p>

<p>The subset operator allows three types of input:</p>
<ul>
<li>A logical vector: elements are selected if corresponding values are <code>TRUE</code>.</li>
<li>A numeric vector: select elements by numeric index.</li>
<li>A character vector: select elements by their name.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a logical vector is used as input it will be re-cycled if necessary. For instance, the following will select by the first, third, fifth, etc. analysis.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb82"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">fGroups</span><span class="op">[</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="cn">TRUE</span>, <span class="cn">FALSE</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In order to select by a <code>character</code> you will need to know the names for each element. These can, for instance, be obtained by the <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">groupNames()</a></code> (feature group names), <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">analyses()</a></code> (analysis names) and <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">names()</a></code> (names for components or feature groups for <code>featureGroups</code> objects) generic functions.</p>

<div id="prioritization-workflow" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#prioritization-workflow" class="anchor"></a>Prioritization workflow</h3>
<p>An important use case of subsetting is prioritization of data. For instance, after statistical analysis only certain feature groups are deemed relevant for the rest of the workflow. A common prioritization workflow is illustrated below:</p>
<div id="htmlwidget-fd8b35516353536e2e80" style="width:500px;height:120px;" class="grViz html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-fd8b35516353536e2e80">{"x":{"diagram":"\ndigraph Prioritization {\n  graph [ rankdir = LR ]\n  node [ shape = box,\n         fixedsize = true,\n         width = 2.3,\n         height = 1,\n         fontsize = 18,\n         fillcolor = darkseagreen1,\n         style = filled ]\n\n    \"Object conversion\" -> \"Prioritization\" -> Subsetting\n}","config":{"engine":"dot","options":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script><p>During the first step the workflow object is converted to a suitable format, most often using the <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">as.data.frame()</a></code> function. The converted data is then used as input for the prioritization strategy. Finally, these results are then used to select the data of interest in the original object.</p>
<p>A very simplified example of such a process is shown below.</p>

<a href="#unOv" class="anchor"></a>Unique and overlapping features</h2>
<p>Often an analysis batch is composed of different sample groups, such as different treatments, influent/effluent etc. In such scenarios it may be highly interesting to evaluate uniqueness or overlap between these samples. Furthermore, extracting overlapping or unique features is a simple but effective prioritization strategy.</p>
<p>The <code><a href="../reference/featureGroups-class.html">overlap()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/unique.html">unique()</a></code> functions can be used to extract overlapping and unique features between replicate groups, respectively.

<p>The <code>specSimParams</code> argument defines the parameters for similarity calculations. It is a <code>list</code>, and the default values are obtained with the <code><a href="../reference/specSimParams.html">getDefSpecSimParams()</a></code> function:</p>

<p>The <code>method</code> field describes the calculation measure: this is either <code>"cosine"</code> or <code>"jaccard"</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>shift</code> field is primarily useful when comparing MS/MS data and defines if and how a spectral shift should be performed prior to similarity calculation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>"none"</code>: The default, no shifting is performed.</li>
<li>
<code>"precursor"</code> The mass difference between the precursor mass of both spectra (<em>i.e.</em> the feature mass) is first calculated. This difference is then subtracted from each of the mass peaks of the second spectrum. This shifting increases similarity if the MS fragmentation process itself occurs similarly (<em>i.e.</em> if both features show similar neutral losses).</li>
<li>
<code>"both</code>” This combines both shifting methods: first peaks are aligned that have the same mass, then the <code>precursor</code> strategy is applied for the remaining mass peaks. This shifting method yields higher similarities if either fragment masses or neutral losses are similar.</li>
</ul>
<p>To override a default setting, simply pass it as an argument to <code>getDefSpecSimParams</code>:</p>

<div id="visComp" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#visComp" class="anchor"></a>Overlapping and unique data</h3>
<p>There are three functions that can be used to visualize overlap and uniqueness between data:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead><tr class="header">
<th>Generic</th>
<th>Classes</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>plotVenn</code></td>
<td>
<code>featureGroups</code>, <code>featureGroupsComparison</code>, <code>formulas</code>, <code>compounds</code>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>plotUpSet</code></td>
<td>
<code>featureGroups</code>, <code>featureGroupsComparison</code>, <code>formulas</code>, <code>compounds</code>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>plotChord</code></td>
<td>
<code>featureGroups</code>, <code>featureGroupsComparison</code>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The most simple comparison plot is a Venn diagram (i.e. <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">plotVenn()</a></code>). This function is especially useful for two or three-way comparisons. More complex comparisons are better visualized with <a href="https://caleydo.org/tools/upset/">UpSet</a> diagrams (i.e. <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">plotUpSet()</a></code>). Finally, chord diagrams (i.e. <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">plotChord()</a></code>) provide visually pleasing diagrams to assess overlap between data.</p>
<p>These functions can either be used to compare feature data or different objects of the same type. The former is typically used to compare overlap or uniqueness between features in different replicate groups, whereas comparison between objects is useful to visualize differences in algorithmic output. Besides visualization, note that both operations can also be performed to modify or combine objects (see <a href="#unOv">unique and overlapping features</a> and <a href="#consensus">algorithm consensus</a>).</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#intReview" class="anchor"></a>Interactively explore and review data</h2>
<p>The <code>checkFeatures</code> and <code>checkComponents</code> functions start a graphical user interface (GUI) which allows you to interactively explore and review feature and components data, respectively.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb134"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/check-GUI.html">checkFeatures</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">fGroups</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="co"># inspect features and feature groups</span>

<p>Both functions allow you to easily explore the data in an interactive way. Furthermore, these functions allow you to remove unwanted data. This is useful to remove for example features that are actually noise and feature groups that shouldn’t be in the same component. To remove an unwanted feature, feature group or components, simply uncheck its ‘keep’ checkbox. The next step is to save the selections you made. A <em>check session</em> is a file that stores which data should be removed. Once the session file is saved the <code>filter</code> function can be used to actually remove the data:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb135"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">fGroupsF</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/generics.html">filter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">fGroups</span>, checkFeaturesSession <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span><span class="op">)</span>

<p>If you saved the session and you re-launch the GUI it will restore the selections made earlier. The <code>clearSession</code> argument can be used to fully clear a session before starting the GUI, hence, all the data will be restored to their ‘keep state’.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb136"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/check-GUI.html">checkFeatures</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">fGroups</span>, clearSession <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="co"># start GUI with fresh session</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It is also possible to use multiple different sessions. This is especially useful if you do not want to overwrite previous session data or want to inspect different objects. In this case the session file name should be specified:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb137"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/check-GUI.html">checkFeatures</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">fGroups</span>, <span class="st">"mysession.yml"</span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="va">fGroupsF</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/generics.html">filter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">fGroups</span>, checkFeaturesSession <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"mysession.yml"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The default session names are <code>"checked-features.yml"</code> and <code>"checked-components.yml"</code> for feature and component data, respectively.</p>
<p>The extension of session file names is <code>.yml</code> since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> file format is used. An advantage of this format is that it is easily readable and editable with a text editor.</p>
<p>Note that the session data is tied to the feature group names of your data. This means that, for instance, when you re-group your feature data after changing some parameters, the session data you prepared earlier cannot be used anymore. Since probably quite some manual work went into creating the session file, a special function is available to import a session that was made for previous data. This function tries its best to guess the new feature group name based on similarity of their retention times and <em>m/z</em> values.</p>

<a href="#report" class="anchor"></a>Reporting</h2>
<p>The previous sections showed various functionalies to inspect and visualize results. An easy and automated way to do this automatically is by using the <em>reporting</em> functionality of <code>patRoon</code>. The following three reporting functions are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code><a href="../reference/reporting.html">reportCSV()</a></code>: exports workflow data to comma-separated value (csv) files</li>
<li>
<code><a href="../reference/reporting.html">reportPDF()</a></code>: generates simple reports by plotting workflow data in portable document files (PDFs)</li>
<li>
<code><a href="../reference/reporting.html">reportHTML()</a></code>: generates interactive and easily explorable reports</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many different arguments available to configure the reporting process. Some common arguments are listed below; for a complete listing see the reference manual (e.g. <code><a href="../reference/reporting.html">?reporting</a></code>).</p>

<p>Which data will be reported is fully configurable. The only workflow object that must be specified are the feature groups (i.e. with the <code>fGroups</code> argument), all other data (e.g. <code>compounds</code>, <code>components</code>) are optional. This means that reporting can be performed at every stage during the workflow, which, for instance, can be useful to quickly inspect results when testing out various settings to generate workflow data.</p>
<p>When formula or compound results are reported with <code><a href="../reference/reporting.html">reportPDF()</a></code> or <code><a href="../reference/reporting.html">reportHTML()</a></code> then only the top ranked candidates are considered. This limtation is often necessary as reporting many candidates will take considerable time. By default the top 5 for each feature group are reported, however, this number can be changed with the <code>formulasTopMost</code> and <code>compoundsTopMost</code> arguments.</p>

<div id="adducts" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#adducts" class="anchor"></a>Adducts</h2>
<p>When generating formulae and compound annotations and some other functionalities it is required to specify the adduct species. Behind the scenes, different algorithms typically use different formats. For instance, in order to specify a protonated species…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GenForm</code> either accepts <code>"M+H"</code> and <code>"+H"</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>MetFrag</code> either accepts the numeric code <code>1</code> or <code>"[M+H]+"</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>SIRIUS</code> accepts <code>"[M+H]+"</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, most algorithms only accept a limited set of possible adducts, which do not necessarily all overlap with each other. The <code><a href="../reference/adduct-utils.html">GenFormAdducts()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/adduct-utils.html">MetFragAdducts()</a></code> functions list the possible adducts for <code>GenForm</code> and <code>MetFrag</code>, respectively.</p>
<p>In order to simplify the situation <code>patRoon</code> internally uses its own format and converts it automatically to the algorithm specific format when necessary. Furthermore, during conversion it checks if the specified adduct format is actually allowed by the algorithm. Adducts in <code>patRoon</code> are stored in the <code>adduct</code> S4 class. Objects from this class specify which elements are added and/or subtracted, the final charge and the number of molecules present in the adduct (e.g. <em>2</em> for a dimer).</p>

<a href="#fOpt" class="anchor"></a>Feature parameter optimization</h2>
<p>Many different parameters exist that may affect the output quality of feature finding and grouping. To avoid time consuming manual experimentation, functionality is provided to largely automate the optimization process. The methodology, which uses design of experiments (DoE), is based on the excellent <a href="IPO">Isotopologue Parameter Optimization (IPO)</a> <code>R</code> package. The functionality of this package is directly integrated in patRoon. Some functionality was added or changed, the most important being support for other feature finding and grouping algorithms besides <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html">XCMS</a> and basic optimization support for qualitative parameters. Nevertheless, the core optimization algorithms are largely untouched.</p>
<p>This section will introduce the most important concepts and functionality. Please see the reference manual for more information (e.g. <code><a href="../reference/feature-optimization.html">?`feature-optimization`</a></code>).</p>

<p>Before starting an optimization experiment we have to define <em>parameter sets</em>. These sets contain the parameters and (initial) numeric ranges that should be tested. A parameter set is defined as a regular <code>list</code>, and can be easily constructed with the <code><a href="../reference/feature-optimization.html">generateFeatureOptPSet()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/feature-optimization.html">generateFGroupsOptPSet()</a></code> functions (for feature finding and feature grouping, respectively).</p>

<p>When optimizing with <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html">XCMS</a> or <a href="https://github.com/hcji/KPIC2">KPIC2</a> a few things have to be considered. First of all, when using the XCMS3 interface (i.e. <code>algorithm="xcms3"</code>) the underlying method that should be used for finding and grouping features and retention alignment should be set. In case these are not set default methods will be used.</p>

<p>From the parameter set a design of experiment will be automatically created. Obviously, the more parameters are specified, the longer such an experiment will take. After an experiment has finished, the optimization algorithm will start a new experiment where numeric ranges for each parameter are increased or decreased in order to more accurately find optimum values. Hence, the numeric ranges specified in the parameter set are only <em>initial</em> ranges, and will be changed in subsequent experiments. After each experiment iteration the results will be evaluated and a new experiment will be started as long as better results were obtained during the last experiment (although there is a hard limit defined by the <code>maxIterations</code> argument).</p>
<p>For some parameters it is recommended or even necessary to set hard limits on the numeric ranges that are allowed to be tested. For instance, setting a minimum feature intensity threshold is highly recommended to avoid excessive processing time and potentially suboptimal results due to excessive amounts of resulting features. Configuring absolute parameter ranges is done by setting the <code>paramRanges</code> argument.</p>

<p>Depending on the used algorithm, several default absolute limits are imposed.

<p>The common operation is to optimize numeric parameters. However, parameters that are not numeric (i.e. <em>qualitative</em>) need a different approach. In this case you will need to define multiple parameter sets, where each set defines a different qualitative value.</p>

<p>In the above example there are two parameter sets: both define the numeric <code>chromFWHM</code> parameter, whereas the qualitative <code>isotopeFilteringModel</code> parameter has a different value for each. Note that we had to specify the <code>chromFWHM</code> twice, this can be remediated by using the <code>templateParams</code> argument:</p>

<p>As its name suggests, the <code>templateParams</code> argument serves as a template parameter set, and its values are essentially combined with each given parameter set. Note that current support for optimizing qualitative parameters is relatively basic and time consuming. This is because tests are essentially repeated for each parameter set (e.g. in the above example the <code>chromFWHM</code> parameter is optimized twice, each time with a different value for <code>isotopeFilteringModel</code>).</p>

<p>The algorithms used by <code>findFeatures</code> detect chromatographic peaks automatically to find the features. However, it is common that not all detected features have ‘proper’ chromatographic peaks, and some features could be just noise. The <a href="https://github.com/KelseyChetnik/MetaClean/">MetaClean</a> <code>R</code> package supports various quality measures for chromatographic peaks. The quality measures include Gaussian fit, symmetry, sharpness and others. In addition, <a href="https://github.com/KelseyChetnik/MetaClean/">MetaClean</a> averages all feature data for each feature group and adds a few additional group specific quality measures (<em>e.g.</em> retention time consistency). Please see <span class="citation">@Chetnik2020</span> for more details. The calculations are integrated into <code>patRoon</code>, and are easily performed with the <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">calculatePeakQualities()</a></code> generic function.</p>

<p>Most often the <code>featureGroups</code> method is only used, unless you want to filter features (discussed below) prior to grouping.</p>
<p>An extension in <code>patRoon</code> is that the qualities are used to calculate <em>peak scores</em>. The score for each quality measure is calculated by normalizing and scaling the values into a <code>0-1</code> range, where zero is the worst and one the best. Note that most scores are relative, hence, the values should only be used to compare features among each other. Finally, a <code>totalScore</code> is calculated which sums all individual scores and serves as a rough overall score indicator for a feature (group).</p>
<p>The qualities and scores are easily obtained with the <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">as.data.table()</a></code> function.</p>

<a href="#applying-machine-learning-with-metaclean" class="anchor"></a>Applying machine learning with MetaClean</h3>
<p>An important feature of <a href="https://github.com/KelseyChetnik/MetaClean/">MetaClean</a> is to use the quality measures to train a machine learning model to automatically recognize ‘good’ and ‘bad’ features. <code>patRoon</code> provides a few extensions to simplify training and using a model. Furthermore, while <code>MetaClean</code> was primarily designed to work with <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html">XCMS</a>, the extensions of <code>patRoon</code> allow the usage of data from all the algorithms supported by <code>patRoon</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>getMCTrainData</code> function can be used to convert data from a <a href="#intReview">feature check session</a> to training data that can be used by <a href="https://github.com/KelseyChetnik/MetaClean/">MetaClean</a>. This allows you to use interactively select good/bad peaks. The workflow looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb172"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="co"># untick the 'keep' checkbox for all 'bad' feature groups</span>
<span class="fu"><a href="../reference/check-GUI.html">checkFeatures</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">fGroupsTrain</span>, <span class="st">"train_session.yml"</span><span class="op">)</span>

<span class="co"># get train data. This gives comparable data as MetaClean::getPeakQualityMetrics()</span>
<span class="va">trainData</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/check-GUI.html">getMCTrainData</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">fGroupsTrain</span>, <span class="st">"train_session.yml"</span><span class="op">)</span>

<span class="co"># use train data with MetaClean with MetaClean::runCrossValidation(),</span>
<span class="co"># MetaClean::getEvaluationMeasures(), MetaClean::trainClassifier() etc</span>
<span class="co"># --&gt; see the MetaClean vignette for details</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once you have created a model with <a href="https://github.com/KelseyChetnik/MetaClean/">MetaClean</a> it can be used with the <code><a href="../reference/check-GUI.html">predictCheckFeaturesSession()</a></code> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb173"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/check-GUI.html">predictCheckFeaturesSession</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">fGroups</span>, <span class="st">"model_session.yml"</span>, <span class="va">model</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will generate another <em>check session file</em>: all the feature groups that are considered good will be with a ‘keep’ state, the others without. As <a href="#intReview">described elsewhere</a>, the <code>checkFeatures</code> function is used to review the results from a session and the <code>filter</code> function can be used to remove unwanted feature groups. Note that <code>calculatePeakQualitites()</code> must be called before <code>getMCTrainData</code>/<code>predictCheckFeaturesSession</code> can be used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong> <code>MetaClean</code> only predicts at the feature group level. Thus, only the kept feature groups from a <em>feature check session</em> will be used for training, and any indivual features that were marked as removed will be ignored.</p>

<p>The feature group data obtained during the workflow can be exported to various formats with the <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">export()</a></code> generic function. There are currently three formats supported: <code>"brukerpa"</code> (Bruker ProfileAnalysis), <code>"brukertasq"</code> (Bruker TASQ) and <code>"mzmine"</code> (mzMine).

<a href="#consensus" class="anchor"></a>Algorithm consensus</h2>
<p>With <code>patRoon</code> you have the option to choose between several algorithms for most workflow steps. Each algorithm is typically characterized by its efficiency, robustness, and may be optimized towards certain data properties. Comparing their output is therefore advantegeuous in order to design an optimum workflow. The <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">consensus()</a></code> generic function will compare different results from different algorithms and returns a <em>consensus</em>, which may be based on minimal overlap, uniqueness or simply a combination of all results from involved objects. The output from the <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">consensus()</a></code> function is of similar type as the input types and is therefore compatible to any ‘regular’ further data processing operations (e.g. input for other workflow steps or plotting). Note that a consensus can also be made from objects generated by the same algorithm, for instance, to compare or combine results obtained with different parameters (e.g. different databases used for compound annotation).</p>
<p>The <code><a href="../reference/generics.html">consensus()</a></code> generic is defined for most workflow objects. Some of its common function arguments are listed below.</p>

<p>Note that current support for generating a consensus between <code>components</code> objects is very simplistic; here results are not compared, but the consensus simply consists a combination of all the components from each object.</p>
<p>Generating a consensus for feature groups involves first generating a <code>featureGroupsComparison</code> object. This step is necessary since (small) deviations between retention times and/or mass values reported by different feature finding/grouping algorithms complicates a direct comparison. The comparison objects are made by the <code><a href="../reference/featureGroups-compare.html">comparison()</a></code> function, and its results can be visualized by the plotting functions discussed <a href="#visComp">in the previous chapter</a>.</p>

<a href="#compclust" class="anchor"></a>Compound clustering</h2>
<p>When large databases such as <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a> or <a href="http://www.chemspider.com/">ChemSpider</a> are used for compound annotation, it is common to find <em>many</em> candidate structures for even a single feature. While choosing the right scoring settings can significantly improve their ranking, it is still very much possible that many candidates of potential interest remain. In this situation it might help to perform <em>compound clustering</em>. During this process, all candidates for a feature are clustered hierarchically on basis of similar chemical structure. From the resulting cluster the <em>maximum common substructure</em> (MCS) can be derived, which represents the largest possible substructure that ‘fit’ in all candidates. By visual inspection of the MCS it may be possible to identify likely common structural properties of a feature.</p>
<p>In order to perform compound clustering the <code><a href="../reference/compounds-cluster.html">makeHCluster()</a></code> generic function should be used. This function heavily relies on chemical fingerprinting functionality provided by <a href="https://github.com/CDK-R/cdkr">rcdk</a>.</p>

<div id="caching" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#caching" class="anchor"></a>Caching</h2>
<p>In <code>patRoon</code> lengthy processing operations such as finding features and generating annotation data is <em>cached</em>. This means that when you run such a calculation again (without changing any parameters), the data is simply loaded from the cache data instead of re-generating it. This in turn is very useful, for instance, if you have closed your R session and want to continue with data processing at a later stage.</p>
<p>The cache data is stored in a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">sqlite</a> database file. This file is stored by default under the name <code>cache.sqlite</code> in the current working directory (for this reason it is very important to always restore your working directory!). However, the name and location can be changed by setting a global package option:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb188"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/options.html">options</a></span><span class="op">(</span>patRoon.cache.fileName <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"~/myCacheFile.sqlite"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For instance, this might be useful if you want to use a shared cache file between projects.</p>
<p>After a while you may see that your cache file can get quite large. This is especially true when testing different parameters to optimize your workflow. Furthermore, you may want to clear the cache after you have updated <code>patRoon</code> and want to make sure that the latest code is used to generate the data. At any point you can simply remove the cache file. A more fine tuned approach which doesn’t wipe all your cached data is by using the <code><a href="../reference/clearCache.html">clearCache()</a></code> function. With this function you can selectively remove parts of the cache file. The function has two arguments: <code>what</code>, which specifies what should be removed, and <code>file</code> which specifies the path to the cache file. The latter only needs to be specified if you want to manage a different cache file.</p>
<p>In order to figure what is in the cache you can run <code><a href="../reference/clearCache.html">clearCache()</a></code> without any arguments:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb189"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/clearCache.html">clearCache</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>#&gt; Please specify which cache you want to remove. Available are:
#&gt; - EICData (3 rows)

<p>Using this output you can re-run the function again, for instance:</p>

<a href="#parallelization" class="anchor"></a>Parallelization</h2>
<p>Some steps in the non-target screening workflow are inherently computationally intensive. To reduce computational times <code>patRoon</code> is able to perform <em>parallelization</em> for most of the important functionality. This is especially useful if you have a modern system with multiple CPU cores and sufficient RAM.</p>
<p>For various technical reasons several parallelization techniques are used, these can be categorized as <em>parallelization of <code>R</code> functions</em> and <em>multiprocessing</em>. The next sections describe both parallelization approaches in order to let you optimize the workflow.</p>

<p>The parallelization is achieved with the <a href="https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future">future</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.batchtools">future.apply</a> <code>R</code> packages. To enable parallelization of these functions the <code>parallel</code> argument must be set to <code>TRUE</code> and the future framework must be properly configured in advance. For example:</p>

<p>Multiprocessing is either performed by executing processes in the background with the <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/processx">processx</a> <code>R</code> package (<em>classic interface</em>) or by futures, which were introduced in the previous section. An overview of the characteristics of both parallelization techniques is shown below.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Which method is used is controlled by the <code>patRoon.MP.method</code> package option. Note that <code><a href="../reference/reporting.html">reportHTML()</a></code> will always use the classic method for <code>pngquant</code>.</p>
<div id="classic-multiprocessing-interface" class="section level4">
<h4 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#classic-multiprocessing-interface" class="anchor"></a>Classic multiprocessing interface</h4>
<p>The classic interface is the ‘original’ method implemented in <code>patRoon</code>, and is therefore well tested and optimized. It is easier to setup, works well with all tools, and is therefore the default method. It is enabled as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb193"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/options.html">options</a></span><span class="op">(</span>patRoon.MP.method <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"classic"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The number of parallel processes is configured through the <code>patRoon.MP.maxProcs</code> option. By default it is set to the number of available CPU cores, which results usually in the best performance. However, you may want to lower this, for instance, to keep your computer more responsive while processing or limit the RAM used by the data processing workflow.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb194"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/options.html">options</a></span><span class="op">(</span>patRoon.MP.maxProcs <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">2</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="co"># do not execute more than two tools in parallel. </span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will change the parallelization for the complete workflow. However, it may be desirable to change this for only a part the workflow. This is easily achieved with the <code><a href="../reference/withOpt.html">withOpt()</a></code> function.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb195"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="co"># do not execute more than two tools in parallel.</span>
<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/options.html">options</a></span><span class="op">(</span>patRoon.MP.maxProcs <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">2</span><span class="op">)</span>

<span class="co"># ... but execute up to four GenForm processes</span>

<span class="op">}</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>withOpt</code> function will temporarily change the given option(s) while executing a given code block and restore it afterwards (it is very similar to the <code>with_options()</code> function from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/withr/index.html">withr</a> <code>R</code> package). Furthermore, notice how <code><a href="../reference/withOpt.html">withOpt()</a></code> does not require you to prefix the option names with <code>patRoon.</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="multiprocessing-with-futures" class="section level4">
<h4 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#multiprocessing-with-futures" class="anchor"></a>Multiprocessing with futures</h4>
<p>The primary goal of the “future” method is to allow parallel processing on one or more external computers. Since it uses the <a href="https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future">future</a> <code>R</code> package, many approaches are supported, such as local parallelization (similar to the <code>classic</code> method), cluster computing via multiple networked computers and more advanced HPC approaches such as <code>slurm</code> via the <a href="https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.batchtools">future.batchtools</a> <code>R</code> package. This parallelization method can be activated as follows:</p>

<p>The <code><a href="../reference/withOpt.html">withOpt()</a></code> function introduced in the previous subsection can also be used to temporarily switch between parallelization approaches, for instance:</p>

<div id="logging" class="section level4">
<h4 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#logging" class="anchor"></a>Logging</h4>
<p>Most tools that are executed in parallel will log their output to text files. These files may contain valuable information, for instance, when an error occurred. By default, the logfiles are stored in the <code>log</code> directory placed in the current working directory. However, you can change this location by setting the <code>patRoon.MP.logPath</code> option. If you set this option to <code>FALSE</code> then no logging occurs.</p>

<div id="notes-when-using-parallelization-with-futures" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#notes-when-using-parallelization-with-futures" class="anchor"></a>Notes when using parallelization with futures</h3>
<p>Some important notes when using the <code>future</code> parallelization method:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GenForm</code> currently performs less optimal with future multiprocessing to the <code>classic</code> approach. Nevertheless, it may still be interesting to use the <code>future</code> method to move the computations to another system to free up resources on your local system.</li>
<li>Behind the scenes the <a href="https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.batchtools">future.apply</a> package is used to schedule the tools to be executed. The <code>patRoon.MP.futureSched</code> option sets the value for the <code>future.scheduling</code> argument to the <code>future_lapply()</code> function, and therefore allows you to tweak the scheduling.</li>
<li>Make sure that <code>patRoon</code> and in case of multiprocessing that the tool to be executed (<code>MetFrag</code>, <code>SIRIUS</code> etc.) are exactly the <em>same</em> version on all computing hosts.</li>
<li>Make sure that <code>patRoon</code> is properly configured on all hosts, <em>e.g.</em> set the <code>patRoon.path.XXX</code> options to ensure all tools can be found.</li>
<li>For <code>MetFrag</code> annotation: if a local database such as <code>PubChemLite</code> is used, it must be present on each computing node as well. Furthermore, the local computer (even if not used for the computations) <em>also</em> must have this file present. Like the previous point, make sure that the <code>patRoon.path.XXX</code> options are set properly.</li>
<li>If you encounter errors then it may be handy to switch to <code><a href="https://future.futureverse.org/reference/plan.html">future::plan("sequential")</a></code> and see if it works or you get more descriptive error messages.</li>
<li>In order to restart the nodes, for instance after re-configuring <code>patRoon</code>, updating <code>R</code> packages etc, simply re-execute <code><a href="https://future.futureverse.org/reference/plan.html">future::plan(...)</a></code>.</li>
<li>Setting the <code>future.debug</code> package option to <code>TRUE</code> may give you more insight what is happening to find problems.</li>
